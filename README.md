# cli-pomodoro-timer
A command line animated pomodoro timer inspired by bashbunni's youtube video :- "https://youtu.be/GfQjJBtO-8Y?si=bX9jey989A9vWzET".
This script takes 3 command line arguments:
1. The length of work session in minutes
2. The length of rest session in minutes
3. The number of sessions in the sitting

You can alias the script to "pomo" so as to run it with
```bash
pomo 90 20 4
```
